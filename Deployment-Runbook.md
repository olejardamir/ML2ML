## 1) Header & Global Semantics
### 0.0 Identity
- **Algorithm:** `UML_OS.Implementation.DeploymentRunbook_v1`
- **Purpose (1 sentence):** Deterministic deployment operations.
- **Spec Version:** `UML_OS.Implementation.DeploymentRunbook_v1` | 2026-02-18 | Authors: Olejar Damir
- **Domain / Problem Class:** Release operations and reliability.
### 0.A Objective Semantics
- Optimization sense: `MINIMIZE`
- Objective type: `Scalar`
- Primary comparison rule: deterministic total preorder over declared primary metric tuple with `EPS_EQ` tie handling.
- Invalid objective policy: `NaN/Inf` ranked as worst-case and handled deterministically per 0.K.
- Minimize failed rollouts and recovery time.
### 0.B Reproducibility Contract
- Replayable given `(release_manifest_hash, environment_profile, deployment_policy_bundle_hash)`.
### 0.C Numeric Policy
- SLO/SLA thresholds evaluated in binary64.
### 0.D Ordering and Tie-Break Policy
- Deployment stages proceed in strict order: dev -> staging -> prod.
### 0.E Parallel, Concurrency, and Reduction Policy
- Parallel instance rollout allowed with deterministic canary and gate aggregation.
### 0.F Environment and Dependency Policy
- Determinism level: `BITWISE` for gate verdicts and rollback decisions.
### 0.G Operator Manifest
- `UML_OS.Deploy.PreflightChecks_v1`
- `UML_OS.Deploy.ExecuteRollout_v1`
- `UML_OS.Deploy.EvaluateHealthGates_v1`
- `UML_OS.Deploy.ExecuteRollback_v1`

### 0.I Outputs and Metric Schema
- Outputs: `(deployment_report, rollback_report?)`.
- Metrics: `rollout_success_rate`, `mean_recovery_time`, `incident_count`.
- Completion status: `success | failed | rolled_back`.
### 0.J Spec Lifecycle Governance
- Gate-policy semantic changes require version bump.
### 0.K Failure and Error Semantics
- Abort or rollback on failed critical gates.
### 0.L Input/Data Provenance
- Release artifacts and manifests are hash-addressed and signed.

---
### 0.Z EQC Mandatory Declarations Addendum
- Seed space: `seed ∈ {0..2^64-1}` when stochastic sub-operators are used.
- PRNG family: `Philox4x32-10` for declared stochastic operators.
- Randomness locality: all sampling occurs only inside declared stochastic operators in section 5.
- Replay guarantee: replayable given (seed, PRNG family, numeric policy, ordering policy, parallel policy, environment policy).
- Replay token: deterministic per-run token contribution is defined and included in trace records.
- Floating-point format: IEEE-754 binary64 unless explicitly declared otherwise.
- Rounding mode: round-to-nearest ties-to-even unless explicitly overridden.
- Fast-math policy: forbidden for critical checks and verdict paths.
- Named tolerances: `EPS_EQ=1e-10`, `EPS_DENOM=1e-12`, and domain-specific thresholds as declared.
- NaN/Inf policy: invalid values trigger deterministic failure handling per 0.K.
- Normalized exponentials: stable log-sum-exp required when exponential paths are used (otherwise N/A).
- Overflow/underflow: explicit abort or clamp behavior must be declared (this contract uses deterministic abort on critical paths).
- Approx-equality: `a ≈ b` iff `|a-b| <= EPS_EQ` when tolerance checks apply.
- Transcendental functions policy: deterministic implementation requirements are inherited from consuming operators.
- Reference runtime class: CPU-only/GPU-enabled/distributed as required by the consuming workflow.
- Compiler/flags: deterministic compilation; fast-math disabled for critical paths.
- Dependency manifest: pinned runtime dependencies and versions are required.
- Determinism level: `BITWISE` for contract-critical outputs unless a stricter local declaration exists.
- Error trace rule: final failure record includes `t`, `failure_code`, `failure_operator`, replay token, and minimal diagnostics.
- Recovery policy: none unless explicitly declared; default is deterministic abort-only.


## 2) System Model
### I.A Persistent State
- environment state snapshots and deployment history.
### I.B Inputs and Hyperparameters
- release bundle, target environment, rollout strategy, health thresholds.
### I.C Constraints and Feasible Set
- Valid deployment requires passing preflight + health gates.
### I.D Transient Variables
- canary status, gate diagnostics, rollback cursor.
### I.E Invariants and Assertions
- production promotion only after staging pass.

### II.F Deterministic Rollout Playbook (Concrete)
- Preflight checks: signature verification, dependency lock verification, config-schema validation, checkpoint compatibility check.
- Canary policy: fixed cohort order `[1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 100%]`, each stage has fixed dwell time and deterministic metric window.
- Gate thresholds:
  - error_rate <= 0.5%
  - p95_latency_delta <= 10%
  - replay_determinism_failures == 0
- Gate verdict determinism: verdict is computed from a frozen metrics snapshot (`metrics_snapshot_hash`) captured at each canary stage; real-time telemetry ordering is not used directly for final verdict computation.
- Rollback triggers: any threshold breach at any stage, signature mismatch, or missing trace artifacts.
- Promotion gate:
  - production promotion requires valid `ExecutionCertificate` and `EvidenceValidate` pass.
  - Signed-field hash equality checks are mandatory before promotion:
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.manifest_hash == release_manifest_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.trace_root_hash == approved_trace_root_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.checkpoint_hash == approved_checkpoint_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.policy_bundle_hash == deployment_policy_bundle_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.lockfile_hash == lockfile_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.dependencies_lock_hash == SHA-256(CBOR_CANONICAL(["deps_lock_v1", lockfile_hash, toolchain_hash, runtime_env_hash]))`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.determinism_profile_hash == runtime_determinism_profile_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.operator_contracts_root_hash == operator_contracts_root_hash`
    - `ExecutionCertificate.signed_payload.lineage_root_hash == expected_lineage_root_hash`
- Required logged artifacts: `release_hash`, `sbom_hash`, `gate_report_hash`, `rollback_report_hash` (if rollback executed).
- Secrets and keys:
  - secret injection only through managed secret stores,
  - key rotation procedure and rotation audit record required before promotion.
- Transport and isolation requirements:
  - control-plane mTLS required,
  - trust-root pinning policy required,
  - minimum cipher-suite baseline required,
  - namespace/network-policy/storage-path segregation required between tenants/environments.
- Migration/DR:
  - migration playbook must include schema/version compatibility checks and rollback points,
  - disaster recovery artifacts required: last-good checkpoint manifest hash, restore procedure hash, incident timeline log.

### II.G Atomic Run Commit Protocol (Normative)
- Finalization of a run is a deterministic commit-pointer protocol:
  1. write immutable content-addressed trace/checkpoint/lineage/certificate objects,
  2. compute and validate bound hashes,
  3. emit terminal WAL finalize record,
  4. publish single COMMITTED pointer object with `{trace_tail_hash, checkpoint_hash, lineage_root_hash, execution_certificate_hash, wal_terminal_hash}` via conditional create-if-absent.
- Crash recovery validates COMMITTED pointer if present; if absent, run remains uncommitted and recovery proceeds from WAL.

### II.H CAS Retention and Garbage Collection (Normative)
- Objects are content-addressed and immutable.
- Retention classes: `golden`, `certified_release`, `experimental`, `ephemeral`.
- Reachability roots include valid execution certificates and pinned model releases.
- GC policy:
  - mark reachable objects from active roots,
  - enforce minimum retention windows by class,
  - sweep only unreachable expired objects.
- GC must never delete objects reachable from active certified artifacts; every deletion emits an auditable hash-chained GC log.

### II.I Key Rotation and Revocation (Normative)
- Signing and redaction keys must declare `key_id`, validity window, and rotation cadence.
- Revocation evidence bundle must be hash-pinned and checked during certificate verification.
- Deployment promotion must fail if signer/redaction keys are revoked or outside validity window at verification time.
