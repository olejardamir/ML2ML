# Canonical CBOR Vectors

Status: PLACEHOLDER

## Purpose
Provide golden vectors for canonical CBOR encoding and validation.

## Format (Proposed)
- Each vector includes: input JSON, expected CBOR hex, and notes.
- Deterministic ordering and numeric edge cases are required.

## Next Step
Replace this file with actual vectors and update tests to load them.
