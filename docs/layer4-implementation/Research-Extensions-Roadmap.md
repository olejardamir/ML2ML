# UML_OS Research Extensions Roadmap
**Spec Version:** v1.0.0 | 2026-02-20 | Authors: Olejar Damir
**Normativity Legend:** `docs/layer1-foundation/Normativity-Legend.md`

**EQC Compliance:** Informational roadmap; non-normative for current production profile guarantees.

## 1) Federated Learning Extension
- Extend execution and evidence contracts for cross-silo coordination.
- Define global privacy-budget coordination semantics.

## 2) Verifiable Delay Functions for Fairness
- Explore VDF-linked sampling proofs for auditable batch-order fairness.

## 3) Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Model Integrity
- Explore zk proof systems for private yet verifiable training correctness claims.

## 4) Adoption Rule
- Any promoted research extension must first define deterministic contracts, migration path, and conformance vectors.

## 1) Header & Global Semantics
### 0.0 Identity
- **Algorithm:** `UML_OS.Structural.Addendum_v1`
- **Purpose (1 sentence):** Structural EQC compliance addendum for "UML_OS Research Extensions Roadmap" without altering existing semantics.
- **Spec Version:** `UML_OS.Structural.Addendum_v1` | 2026-02-20 | Authors: ML2ML
- **Domain / Problem Class:** Documentation governance and structural conformance.
### 0.Z EQC Mandatory Declarations Addendum
- This document inherits deterministic, numeric, and failure policies from its referenced normative contracts unless explicitly overridden.

---
## 6) Procedure
```text
1. Read and apply this document together with its referenced normative contracts.
2. Preserve deterministic ordering and evidence linkage requirements declared by those contracts.
3. Emit deterministic documentation compliance record for governance tracking.
```
