# UML_OS Disaster Recovery Operations Runbook
**EQC Compliance:** Merged single-file EQC v1.1 Option A.

**Algorithm:** `UML_OS.Operations.DisasterRecovery_v1`  
**Purpose (1 sentence):** Define deterministic operations procedures for severe failures, including full cluster loss and data corruption events.  
**Spec Version:** `UML_OS.Operations.DisasterRecovery_v1` | 2026-02-20 | Authors: Olejar Damir

---
## 1) Full Cluster Failure Recovery
1. Recover control plane state from signed backups.
2. Reconstitute operator registry and trust roots.
3. Re-establish key material and HSM/KMS trust links.
4. Restore latest valid checkpoint/trace/wal artifacts.
5. Run deterministic replay integrity check before reopening traffic.

## 2) Data Corruption Recovery
- Detection:
  - checksum/hash mismatches during artifact validation/restore.
- Recovery:
  - isolate corrupted objects,
  - recover from secondary replica or lineage reconstruction,
  - verify rebuilt object hash links before promotion.

## 3) Incident Post-Mortem Linkage
- Every DR incident MUST produce:
  - incident summary,
  - affected hash roots,
  - evidence links,
  - remediation tasks linked to specific contract sections.

## 1) Header & Global Semantics
### 0.0 Identity
- **Algorithm:** `UML_OS.Structural.Addendum_v1`
- **Purpose (1 sentence):** Structural EQC compliance addendum for "UML_OS Disaster Recovery Operations Runbook" without altering existing semantics.
- **Spec Version:** `UML_OS.Structural.Addendum_v1` | 2026-02-20 | Authors: ML2ML
- **Domain / Problem Class:** Documentation governance and structural conformance.
### 0.Z EQC Mandatory Declarations Addendum
- This document inherits deterministic, numeric, and failure policies from its referenced normative contracts unless explicitly overridden.

---
## 6) Procedure
```text
1. Read and apply this document together with its referenced normative contracts.
2. Preserve deterministic ordering and evidence linkage requirements declared by those contracts.
3. Emit deterministic documentation compliance record for governance tracking.
