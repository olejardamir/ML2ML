## 1) Header & Global Semantics
### 0.0 Identity
- **Algorithm:** `UML_OS.Implementation.Backlog_v1`
- **Purpose (1 sentence):** Deterministic implementation backlog governance.
### 0.A Objective Semantics
- Optimization sense: `MINIMIZE`
- Objective type: `Scalar`
- Primary objective: minimize ambiguous implementation status.
### 0.B Reproducibility Contract
- Replayable given `(backlog_hash, operator_registry_root_hash, roadmap_hash)`.
### 0.C Numeric Policy
- Priority/severity fields use exact integer domains.
### 0.D Ordering and Tie-Break Policy
- Tasks sorted by `(priority, subsystem, operator_id)`.
### 0.E Parallel, Concurrency, and Reduction Policy
- Parallel work allowed; status merge is deterministic.
### 0.F Environment and Dependency Policy
- Backlog status changes require linked artifact hashes (PR/test/report).
### 0.G Operator Manifest
- `UML_OS.ImplBacklog.CreateTask_v1`
- `UML_OS.ImplBacklog.UpdateStatus_v1`
- `UML_OS.ImplBacklog.ValidateCoverage_v1`
- `UML_OS.Error.Emit_v1`
### 0.H Namespacing and Packaging
- `UML_OS.ImplBacklog.*`
### 0.I Outputs and Metric Schema
- Outputs: `(backlog_report, coverage_report)`
- Metrics: `tasks_total`, `tasks_done`, `coverage_pct`
### 0.J Spec Lifecycle Governance
- State machine changes are MAJOR.
### 0.K Failure and Error Semantics
- Invalid transitions fail deterministically.
### 0.L Input/Data Provenance
- Tasks must reference operator ids and contract versions.

---
## 2) System Model
### I.A Persistent State
- Backlog task table and transition log.
### I.B Inputs and Hyperparameters
- task specs, owners, dependencies, evidence refs.
### I.C Constraints and Feasible Set
- Valid iff every required operator has an implementation task.
### I.D Transient Variables
- update diffs and validation diagnostics.
### I.E Invariants and Assertions
- Task IDs unique; transitions append-only.
- Productization invariants:
  - every release train contains profile packaging tasks (`core`, `managed`, `regulated`),
  - observability bridge tasks produce deterministic mapping artifacts,
  - certification tasks emit externally-verifiable evidence bundles,
  - reference-stack tasks cover WAL -> trace -> checkpoint -> certificate -> replay end-to-end flow.

**Purity class:** IO

## 6) Procedure
```text
1. CreateTask_v1 for uncovered required operators
2. UpdateStatus_v1 as implementation progresses
3. ValidateCoverage_v1 before release gates
4. Validate mandatory productization epics before release gates
5. Emit backlog_report + coverage_report
```

## 7) Trace & Metrics
### Logging rule
- Backlog updates emit deterministic task transition events.
### Trace schema
- `run_header`: backlog_version, registry_hash
- `iter`: task_id, transition, status
- `run_end`: coverage_report_hash
### Metric schema
- `tasks_total`, `tasks_done`, `coverage_pct`
### Comparability guarantee
- Comparable iff same required operator set and backlog schema.

---
## 8) Validation
#### VII.A Lint rules (mandatory)
- No orphan operator tasks; no illegal state transitions.
#### VII.B Operator test vectors (mandatory)
- Transition/state and coverage tests.
#### VII.C Golden traces (mandatory)
- Golden backlog evolution traces.

---
## 9) Refactor & Equivalence
#### VIII.A Equivalence levels
- E0 for coverage verdict and transition log.
#### VIII.B Allowed refactor categories
- Storage/index changes preserving task semantics.
#### VIII.C Equivalence test procedure (mandatory)
- Exact compare of coverage reports.

---
## 10) Checkpoint/Restore
### Checkpoint contents
- Task state snapshot and transition cursor.
### Serialization
- Canonical CBOR.
### Restore semantics
- Resumed backlog processing must preserve transition order and coverage results.
