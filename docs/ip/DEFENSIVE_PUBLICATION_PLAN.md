# Defensive Publication Plan

Status: DRAFT

## Purpose
Establish a dated disclosure plan that creates prior art and anchors the open-source moat.

## Publication Cadence
- Monthly: release notes + updated conformance vectors.
- Quarterly: consolidated technical disclosure summary.

## Initial Disclosures (Target: v0.1)
- Canonical serialization rules and hash preimage definitions.
- Conformance vector catalog and verification steps.
- Hello-core deterministic run procedure and golden artifacts.

## Tracking
- Keep a changelog entry for each disclosure in release notes.
- Link disclosures to artifacts and hashes.
