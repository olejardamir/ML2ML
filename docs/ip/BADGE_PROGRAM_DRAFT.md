# Compatibility Badge Program (Draft)

Status: DRAFT

## Goal
Define criteria and evidence required for a future Glyphser compatibility badge.

## Candidate Criteria (v0.1)
- Conformance suite PASS with published vectors.
- Hello-core reproducibility (byte-identical outputs within declared environment constraints).
- Verified artifact hashes and trace final hash consistency.

## Evidence Package (Proposed)
- Conformance report (machine + human).
- Artifact bundle with hashes.
- Environment manifest with pinned dependencies.

## Next Steps
- Refine criteria after v0.1 stabilizes.
- Define badge tiers and renewal cadence.
