# Glyphser Brand & Naming Policy

## Identity Hierarchy
* **Organization:** Astrocytech
* **Project Name:** Glyphser

## Public Messaging Rules
1.  **Avoid "UML" in Product Names:** Do not use "UML" in public-facing marketing or high-level product titles to avoid trademark confusion. Use "Glyphser" as the product name and "Astrocytech" for company attribution.
2.  **Affiliation Statement:** All public documentation should include: *"Astrocytech is an independent implementation; no official affiliation or certification claims are made unless explicitly stated."*
3.  **Casing:** Always use **Astrocytech** and **Glyphser** (PascalCase). Lowercase `glyphser` is reserved for CLI/tool IDs and telemetry attributes.

## Repository Mapping
* `/src/glyphser`: Public API and User Tooling.
* `/docs/layer2-specs/Glyphser-Kernel...`: Internal engine specifications.
