# Astrocytech Brand & Naming Policy

## Identity Hierarchy
* **Organization:** Astrocytech
* **Internal Codename:** UML_OS (Use only in technical specs and kernel-level code)
* **Public Product Name:** Astrocytech Conformance Kit (v0.1)

## Public Messaging Rules
1.  **Avoid "UML" in Product Names:** Do not use "UML" in public-facing marketing or high-level product titles to avoid trademark confusion. Use "Astrocytech" as the primary identifier.
2.  **Affiliation Statement:** All public documentation should include: *"Astrocytech is an independent implementation; no official affiliation or certification claims are made unless explicitly stated."*
3.  **Casing:** Always use **Astrocytech** (PascalCase) and **UML_OS** (Snake_Case).

## Repository Mapping
* `/src/astrocytech`: Public API and User Tooling.
* `/docs/layer2-specs/UML_OS-Kernel...`: Internal engine specifications.
